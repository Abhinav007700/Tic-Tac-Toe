      <h2>About Tic Tac Toe</h2>
      <p>Tic Tac Toe is a classic game played on a 3x3 grid. The goal of the game is to get three of your own symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</p>
      <p>Each player takes turns placing their symbol (X or O) on an empty cell in the grid. The first player to achieve three in a row wins the game. If all cells are filled and no player has three in a row, the game is a tie.</p>
      <p>4x4 Tic-Tac-Toe is a variation of the classic game played on a larger 4x4 grid. The objective is to get four symbols in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. It offers a more challenging and strategic gameplay experience with expanded possibilities for winning combinations.</p>
      <p>The rules are the same, with the first player to achieve a line of four symbols winning the game.</p>
